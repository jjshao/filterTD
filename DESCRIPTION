Description: A set of functions to aid in filtering telemetry data taken from
    Innovasea (Vemco) data collection devices. It provides a way to quickly 
    visualize telemetry data by providing simpler functions to summarize data 
    from sync and animal tags as well as functions that calculate regressions 
    and quantiles based on HPE values. Includes two R markdown reports.
